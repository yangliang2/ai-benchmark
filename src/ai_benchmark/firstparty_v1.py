"""First-party eval v1: task directories and execution-verified grading
(ticket #10). Sits beside v0 rather than replacing it — the two are separate
benchmarks and must never pool.

Where a v0 task is a prompt plus a check regex, a v1 task is a directory: the
prompt, a small hand-authored starting repository the agent works in, and
held-out grading tests the agent never sees. Grading runs those tests for
real — copy the pristine repo, apply the run's workdir diff, overlay the
canonical grading files over any same-path files the agent touched, run
pytest in a fresh temp dir with a timeout — so `resolved` is
execution-verified, the same standard as SWE-bench, not pattern-verified.

Accepted limitation (CONTEXT.md): grading executes agent-written code in a
local subprocess with a timeout, not a sandbox. Task repositories are
stdlib-only, so grading needs no network and no installs.
